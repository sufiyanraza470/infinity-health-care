        <h1>Circadian Rhythm – Finding Co-Creation Without Interference</h1>
        <div class="Circadian-Rhythm">
            <p>Today’s article will be about the <b>Circadian Rhythms</b> of our body. How our body anatomically
                programs <b>Energy, Frequency and Vibration.</b> In this article we will continue to look through a 12
                channel meridian perspective, following its cyclical flow.</p>

            <img src="images/circadian-rhythm.webp" alt="#">

            <p>How can infinite waveforms co-create with each other in continuous harmony? What does this wave look
                like? How does our body create it? And how can it be seen within the perspectives of Chinese Medicine
                and the meridian systems?</p>

            <p>As we string these parts and pieces together, the first aspect we need to bring awareness to is the
                formation of our <b>Helical Heart.</b> Gathering from the works of Dr. Gerald Buckberg an American heart
                surgeon and other pioneering heart specialists, we have re-discovered that <b>our heart is actually one
                    long muscle strand that has twisted and spiraled into each other,</b></p>

            <img src="images/cosmic-toroidal-doughnut.webp" alt="#">

            <p><b>in the shape of a cosmic toroidal doughnut. </b>Our heart is a muscle band that has formed in the
                shape of the golden spiral or Phi (1.618…). Our hearts have grown physically and energetically into the
                shape of the Galaxy and Universe.</p>

            <img src="images/flower.webp" alt="#">

            <p>In this form our hearts have infinite capacity for squeezing and compression. This is extremely important
                and what makes the heart very unique compared to all of our other organs within the body. This squeezing
                creates implosive energy. As we create different emotions, each different emotion creates its own unique
                waveform. When we are experiencing <b>love</b> — which is a very coherent sine wave because it
                encapsulates all other types of</p>

            <p>emotions into one, our heart generates perfect</p>

            <p>golden ratio spiraling sine waves.</p>

            <p>As shown in the picture above, when we maintain these soundwaves, sine waves, the heart frequency of
                love, we set the frequency and the charge in motion in our blood to carry this heart song, like a
                resonant tuning fork to all other aspects of our body. Depending on how out of resonance with this
                frequency all other parts of the body are, this will determine how far this sound wave will travel
                through the body before it is dissipated from interference. (like Whale who sings its song and who has
                the largest heart on Earth)</p>

            <p>The heart will communicate through the blood vessels, The blood vessels are the heart’s domain, it
                commands the blood. If you are familiar with my 12 channel meridian continuum work you will know that
                the heart blood will travel in two general directions. One part will travel upwards toward <b>Heaven</b>
                and into the vicinity of the brain, and a second part will travel downwards towards <b>Earth,</b> to
                explore, experience and conquer.</p>

            <img src="images/heart-vins.webp" alt="#">

            <p>The Liver’s job is to complete the finalization of the blood, the purification process before the
                circulated blood returns back to the heart. If we are physically out of tune with our Destiny, Purpose &
                Plan for this life, we will begin to see the circulating blood that is above our heart become out of
                coherence with the circulating blood that is below our heart. Our hemispheres of blood will be out of
                resonance with each other and not be able to provide a systematic wide frequency blueprint.</p>

            <p><b>We already need a brief recap.</b> If all cylinders within the body are firing properly in a coherent
                circulating rhythm, <b>our lungs (breath)</b> will be tuning the speed of our heart –> <b>our heart love
                    frequency (our heart beat in natural circadian rhythm with galaxies and universes)</b> if we are
                radiating love, we will be creating the <b>perfect sine wave for infinite compression</b> without
                interference. Our heart song ( a phononic soundwave) will travel through the liquid of our blood,
                programming the circadian rhythm by tuning the frequency and firing rate of all of our cells and bodily
                functions.</p>

            <img src="images/brain-part.webp" alt="#">

            <p>If the <b>heart song</b> (phononics) from the heart vessels circulating through the body enter the
                <b>brain,</b> they will program the firing rate/frequency of the heart to be in synchronicity with the
                ventricles and <b>cerebrospinal fluid</b> of the brain. Afterwards the resonant <b>CSF fluid</b> will
                then travel down the spinal column in a harmonious nature with the heart. Doing this we will have
                achieved Heart and Mind coherence.</p>

            <p>As the <b>Cerebrospinal Fluid</b> (also called commonly called Craniosacral Fluid in craniosacral
                therapy) travels down the spinal cord carrying our heart song. This resonant frequency will also ‘tune”
                / program the fibers and cells of the peripheral nervous system, which cyclically follows a pathway from
                the central nervous system. This means that we will be programming our sympathetic and parasympathetic
                system and all nervous aspects of our body.</p>

            <img src="images/subconscious.webp" alt="#">

            <p>Our nervous system contains our <b>subconscious thoughts and waveforms.</b> That which we use to engage
                in functions without our direct awareness. These subsconscious waveforms can be acting on both physical
                functions, such as programming the body’s breathing or digestion. Or acting on our nervous system which
                can subconsciously create programs for the dreaming body, astral body or our energy bodies, so that we
                can make programs to travel into other dimensions and make co-creations. Aware or unaware.</p>

            <p>By bringing our heart song, which is our phononic waveforms carried within our blood into our nervous
                system via our cerebrospinal fluid, <b>we begin to bring consciousness to the subconscious areas of our
                    body.</b> This is how we eradicate subconscious or unconscious personal, social, or ancestral
                programming from our body. We do this with our awareness, energy, frequency and vibration. We must do
                this out of a state of joy and not as a tedious process.. It is at this point where we can intentionally
                reprogram our body mechanics the way that we want to. We can remove some of the age old accumulated junk
                that is running an OS software that is 1000’s of generations out of date.</p>

            <p>The trick is to maintain joy, happiness and love within our lives. To find joy in our menial moments,
                out-creating our subconscious programming. As we do this process we are achieving coherence with all
                circadian rhythms, therefore connecting all anatomical aspects of our bodies to run in coherence and
                unison.</p>

            <p>If we are maintaining the frequency of love, we are naturally in a rhythmic procession with the frequency
                of the Earth, which is the <b>Schumann Resonance.</b> Yet we also come into coherence with all other
                <b>galactic and universal cycles of time keeping.</b> With continuous effort and repetition we create
                self illumination. We increase our density within this world and we sing in union with the stars and
                planets of this universe without any interference.</p>

            <p>Following this blueprint you will also be able to integrate all body systems of the meridian cycle that I
                left out. I left them for the sake of simplicity for this article. Just self-investigate and see how
                they individually can imprint into the blood. You will be able to integrate the Large Intestine,
                Stomach, Spleen, Small Intestine, Triple Heater, Gallbladder, and all other systems by directly
                investigating how it influences the blood. (Ex, how the microbiotics of the stomach, large and small
                intestine etc digest nutrients which influence the blood)</p>

            <p>The heart when connected to the love frequency creates the golden ratio spiral as a waveform. This
                waveform creates a vortex within the heart as the heart energetically compresses all perfectly spiralled
                waveforms into a plasmoid, a singularity, or a point in no-time. This is where the heart is in
                connection with all that there is, was and ever will be. Thoughts and ideas become self organized. Here
                we are connected to all matter in a mathematical expression. It is a quantum expression.</p>

            <img src="images/finteri.webp" alt="#">

            <p>t is only the waveform of Phi that allows infinite numbers of sine waves to be connected and nest within
                each other without any interference patterns. This allows for infinite co-creativity. This is what the
                heart does, and this allows us to never step on the journey of others. We each have our individual
                playground of infinite space.</p>

            <p>With heart intention and joy we can program all aspects of our bodies circadian rhythm to be functioning
                in coherence and unison with each other. <b> We rhythmically become in tune with the plants, animals,
                    insects and all other people. Including other planets, other galaxies and universes.</b> All we have
                to do is tune in and enjoy ourselves and not be a stubborn stick in the mud.</p>

            <img src="images/finteri-2.webp" alt="#">
            <img src="images/finteri-video.gif" alt="">

            <p><b>Lungs</b> – Breath tunes the → <b>Heart</b> rhythm tunes all the → <b>Blood Vessels</b> → <b>enter
                    brain, phase lock</b> with ventricle fluid → wave enters <b>Corpus callosum</b>, connecting L&R
                brain hemispheres non destructively creating a nesting wave → Phase locked vibrating fluid travels down
                the <b>spine as CSF</b> into the <b>nerve endings</b> → transforming <b>subconscious programming</b> /
                interference programs = can no longer exist.</p>

            <p>*See the work of Dan Winter to further understand the geometry, magnetic electrical engineering, physics
                and mathematics of how the golden sine wave as Phi mathematically allow all waves to join each other.
